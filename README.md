# Armut Online Services Platform - Product Recommendation System

## Business Problem

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, aims to connect service providers with customers who need their services. To enhance the user experience and increase customer engagement, Armut wants to develop a product recommendation system using Association Rule Learning. This system will provide personalized service recommendations to users based on their past service purchases.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about customers' service purchases and the corresponding service categories. Each service is associated with a ServiceID and a CategoryID, representing different services and categories. Additionally, the dataset includes the date and time when each service was purchased.

## Task 1: Data Preparation

In this task, we'll perform data preparation steps to enable Association Rule Learning.

## Task 2: Association Rule Learning

In this task, we'll generate association rules for product recommendations.

## Recommendations

Let's provide a recommendation for a user who last purchased the service with ID `2_0`.

The following services are recommended for the user who last purchased the service `2_0`:
- Recommendation 1
- Recommendation 2
- ...
- Recommendation 10

Please note that the names of the services are anonymized in the dataset. For better user experience, you can map the ServiceID and CategoryID combinations to actual service names.

## Conclusion

In this project, we have developed a product recommendation system using Association Rule Learning. The system suggests personalized service recommendations based on users' past service purchases, helping to improve customer satisfaction and engagement on the Armut platform.
